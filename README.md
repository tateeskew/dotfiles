My dotfiles / commandline existence

These dotfiles are heavy on the zsh, vim, python front.  There are a few things within the weechat and zshrc that you may want to customize for your user.

If you want to install and try it out, execute the bootstrap:

curl -L https://raw.github.com/tateeskew/dotfiles/master/bin/bootstrap.sh | sh

Enjoy and feel free to issue pull requests.
